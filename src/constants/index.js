I am a dedicated and versatile full stack developer who is constantly working to improve myself and solve complex problems.
 As a college student, I have been honing my skills in front-end technologies like React and Next.js, and back-end technologies
  such as Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. I recently completed a 100-day code challenge on LinkedIn and have started it
   again to further enhance my coding abilities. I have crafted several projects to improve my skills and knowledge. Besides coding,
    I love to read books and work out. My journey in web development began with a deep curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved
     into a passion where I strive to learn and adapt to new challenges.`;
